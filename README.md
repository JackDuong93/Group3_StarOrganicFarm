# Group3_StarOrganicFarm

This is the result of our working through this eProject

We have faced a lot of problems, and difficulty, but after all our team together stay confident and solve it all.

We hope this Project can show part of our activities as well as our skills, through all the practice time on the class and on ourself's hard study time at home.

We would like to give a big Thank to Ms Lanh, the teacher who leading us and teach us the skills and knowledge to make this Project.

We will keep study hard, and be a professional web developer in the future.

Thank you.
